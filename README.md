# Job/Activity Time Tracker for WordPress

This is a WordPress plugin that allows you to track the time you spend on your projects and tasks, or whatever you're attempting to keep track of. Nuttin fancy, just a simple tool to help you keep track of time.

Tracking data is saved to the database via AJAX calls, using a custom post type 'jobs' (hidden from public view).

Other than that, nothing much to say... I just built this little tool to help me keep track of time spent, main reason being that I couldn't really find a tool that was simple and fitted my needs.

Oh, and it also auto converts time spent to invoiceable units, so you can easily see how much you should bill your clients.

Functionality will probably be added in the future, but for now, this is it.

Should be a good jumping off point if you're looking to build something similar.
